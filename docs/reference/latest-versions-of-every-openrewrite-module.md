# Latest versions of every OpenRewrite module

OpenRewrite's modules are published to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=org.openrewrite).
Each time a release is made, a bill of materials artifact is also published to correctly align and manage the versions of all published artifacts.
The Gradle plugin is published to the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.openrewrite.rewrite).

It is highly recommended that developers use the [rewrite-recipe-bom](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-recipe-bom)
to align the versions of Rewrite's modules to ensure compatibility.
The use of the "bill of materials" means that a developer will only need to specify explicit versions of the BOM and the build plugins:

| Module                                                                                                                | Version    | License |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ---------- | ------- |
| [com.gepardec:write-open-rewrite](https://github.com/moderneinc/write-open-rewrite)                                   | [1.0.1-SNAPSHOT](https://github.com/moderneinc/write-open-rewrite/releases/tag/v1.0.1-SNAPSHOT) | [Moderne Proprietary](https://docs.moderne.io/licensing/overview) |
