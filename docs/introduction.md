# OpenRewrite Collection by Gepardec

OpenRewrite is an open-source automated refactoring ecosystem for source code, enabling developers to effectively eliminate technical debt within their repositories.

It consists of an auto-refactoring engine that runs prepackaged, open-source refactoring recipes for common framework migrations, security fixes, and stylistic consistency tasks â€“ reducing your coding effort from hours or days to minutes. Build tool plugins like the [OpenRewrite Gradle plugin](./reference/gradle-plugin-configuration.md) and the [OpenRewrite Maven plugin](./reference/rewrite-maven-plugin.md) help you run these recipes on one repository at a time.

 While the original focus was on the Java language, the OpenRewrite community is continuously [expanding language and framework coverage](./reference/supported-languages.md). Thousands of great individuals and teams are working together to make software seamless to update and continuously secure.
