# Find and fix vulnerable dependencies

**org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck**

_This software composition analysis (SCA) tool detects and upgrades dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe **only** upgrades to the latest **patch** version.  If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this recipe will not make any changes. Vulnerability information comes from the [GitHub Security Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database), which aggregates vulnerability data from several public databases, including the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) maintained by the United States government. Dependencies following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) will see their _patch_ version updated where applicable._

## Options

| Type | Name | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `String` | scope | Match dependencies with the specified scope |
| `Boolean` | overrideManagedVersion | *Optional*. This flag can be set to explicitly override a managed dependency's version. The default for this flag is `false`. |
| `Boolean` | addMarkers | *Optional*. Report each vulnerability in search results. If this is off, it is easier to see suggested changes. |

## Data Tables (Only available on the [Moderne platform](https://app.moderne.io/))

### Vulnerability report

_A vulnerability report that includes detailed information about the affected artifact and the corresponding CVEs._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| CVE | The CVE number. |
| Group | The first part of a dependency coordinate `com.google.guava:guava:VERSION`. |
| Artifact | The second part of a dependency coordinate `com.google.guava:guava:VERSION`. |
| Version | The resolved version. |
| Fixed in version | The minimum version that is no longer vulnerable. |
| Fixable with version update only | Whether the vulnerability is likely to be fixed by increasing the dependency version only, with no code modifications required. This is a heuristic which assumes that the dependency is accurately versioned according to [semver](https://semver.org/). |
| Summary | The summary of the CVE. |
| Base score | The calculated base score. |
| Depth | Zero for direct dependencies. |
| CWEs | Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers; semicolon separated. |


## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.DependencyVulnerabilityCheckExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:

{% code title="rewrite.yml" %}
```yaml
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.DependencyVulnerabilityCheckExample
displayName: Find and fix vulnerable dependencies example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.java.dependencies.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck:
      scope: compile
      overrideManagedVersion: false
      addMarkers: null
```
{% endcode %}

Now that `com.yourorg.DependencyVulnerabilityCheckExample` has been defined activate it and take a dependency on org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:1.2.4 in your build file:
{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Gradle" %}
1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:
{% code title="build.gradle" %}
```groovy
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("6.5.10")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.DependencyVulnerabilityCheckExample")
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-java-dependencies:1.2.4")
}
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Maven" %}
1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:
{% code title="pom.xml" %}
```xml
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>5.14.1</version>
        <configuration>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.DependencyVulnerabilityCheckExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.openrewrite.recipe</groupId>
            <artifactId>rewrite-java-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>1.2.4</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
{% endcode %}
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Moderne CLI" %}
You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

{% code title="shell" %}
```shell
mod run . --recipe DependencyVulnerabilityCheck
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
